Capstone Project Ideas: 

#1 Does the success of the stock market correlate with twitter sentiment? Can the stock 
market be predicted based on sentiment and volume of tweets regarding a particular
stock/subject/company? 

Text classification: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences
Stock Market data: https://www.quandl.com/3

Skills: Web scraping, NLP, sentiment analysis, ML 

#2 Inventory and recommendation system:
Client wants to get a particular retail item today (for ease, I'll limit it to shampoo 
products), 
but does not know what store carries it (limited to three department stores: Planet Beauty,
Target and CVS).
Client inputs name of item into search engine.
App will return store name and location that carries the item.
If item does not exist, app will recommend an item like the one the client is looking for.
Similarity could depend on: price, quality (star rating on amazon), popularity (twitter), 
of product.

Skills: Web scraping, NLP, ML

#3 Correlation between minimum wage in CA and unemployment in CA given job type,
race, gender, SES. 
Predict rate of unemployment 1 year from now given continued minimum wage trend.
